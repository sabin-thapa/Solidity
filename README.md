## Solidity
**What is Solidity?** 
- Contract-oriented, static-typed high level programming language.
- Used for implementing smart contracts.
- Highly influenced by C++, Python and JS.
- Designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
> EVMs are run-time environments for running contract code in th Ethereum platform.

**What is Ethereum?**
- Decentralized blockchain platform that runs smart contracts.
- Establishes a peer-to-peer network that securely executes and verifies aplication code, called smart contracts.
> Smart contracts allow participants to transact with wach other without a trusted central authority.

**What is Smart Contract?**
- A computer protocol intented to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract.
- Programs stored in a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met.
- Self-executing program that automates the actions required in an agreement or contract.

**What is EVM?**
- Runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum.
- Focuses on providing security and executing untrusted code by computers all over the world.
- Computational engine which acts like a decentralized computer that has millions of executable projects.
- Virtual computer used by developers to create decentralized applications.
